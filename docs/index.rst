pylib3d_mec_ginac
*********************************************

`lib3d_mec_ginac <http://www.imem.unavarra.es/3d_mec/download/lib3d-mec-ginac/eccomas2007_paper.pdf>`_ is a library for multibody mechanical systems simulations that
was developed in C++ due to its performance requirements for symbolic computation.

This project aims to provide an extension to the Python language with additional
features to improve interaction between the user and the library.

You can create parametrized mechanical systems using symbolic algebra and pose the
associated cinematic and dinamic equations.
Such equations can be exported to other CAS systems like Matlab or Maple.
They can also be used to perform an interactive physical simulation of the mechanism in a graphical environment built by this library.

The `source code <https://github.com/Vykstorm/pylib3d-mec-ginac>`_ is avaliable on Github and is released under the GPLv2 (General public license version 2).
